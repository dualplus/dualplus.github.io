However, labeling the data is time-consuming and manpower consuming. To address this issue, we propose to segment the eyes using unlabelled eye images and a weak empirical prior on the eye shape. To make the segmentation interpretable, we leverage the prior knowledge of eye shape by converting the self-supervised learned landmarks of each eye component to the segmentation maps. Specifically, we design a symmetrical auto-encoder architecture to learn disentangled representations of eye appearance and eye shape in a self-supervised manner. The eye shape is represented as the landmarks on the eyes. The proposed method encodes the eye images into the eye shapes and appearance features and then it reconstructs the image according to the eye shape and the appearance feature of another image.\nSince the landmarks of the training images are unknown, we require the generated landmarks' pictorial representations to have the same distribution as a known prior by minimizing an adversarial loss. Experiments on TEyeD and UnitySeg datasets demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised method is comparable with supervised ones. When the labeled data is insufficient, the proposed self-supervised method provides a better pre-trained model than other initialization methods.","tags":[],"title":"Landmark-aware Self-supervised Eye Semantic Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuran Sun","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638407222,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638407222,"objectID":"76745d5131bb2860dc7308900f81bf75","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2021-fg-emoco/","publishdate":"2021-12-02T09:07:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-fg-emoco/","section":"publication","summary":"Current AU datasets lack sufficiency and diversity because annotating facial action units (AUs) is laborious. The lack of labeled AU datasets bottlenecks the training of a discriminative AU detector. Compared with AUs, the basic emotional categories are relatively easy to annotate and they are highly correlated to AUs. To this end, we propose an Emotion-aware Contrastive Learning (EmoCo) framework to obtain representations that retain enough AU-related information. EmoCo leverages enormous and diverse facial images without AU annotations while labeled with the six universal facial expressions. EmoCo extends the prevalent self-supervised learning architecture of Momentum Contrast by simultaneously classifying the learned features into different emotional categories and distinguishing features within each emotional category in instance level. In the experiments, we train EmoCo using AffectNet dataset labeled with emotional categories. The EmoCo-learned features outperform other self-supervised learned representations in AU detection tasks on DISFA, BP4D, and GFT datasets. The EmoCo-pretrained models that finetuned on the AU datasets outperform most of the state-of-the-art AU detection methods.","tags":[],"title":"Emotion-aware Contrastive Learning for Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"3bf44c81f2a197de01edde90bcd77783","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/team/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/team/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"VIPL Affective Computing Group","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635383968,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635383968,"objectID":"9c4ec30a61a0a7d6d042cdcf00a8b854","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/project/asd/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T09:19:28+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/asd/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["psyc-discorders"],"title":"TODO","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635383836,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635383836,"objectID":"56dd1866c9c8361e8461ef27631b77fc","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/project/2d_gaze/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T09:17:16+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/2d_gaze/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["gaze-estimation"],"title":"Point-of-Gaze(PoG) Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635383829,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635383829,"objectID":"e4da72a0b1fb61dcab2871626b41583f","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/project/3d_gaze/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T09:17:09+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/3d_gaze/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["gaze-estimation"],"title":"3D Gaze Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635383588,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635383588,"objectID":"c71b964def36101645e34393300c92d0","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/project/au/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T09:13:08+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/au/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["facial-expression-analysis","AU"],"title":"Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635383170,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635383170,"objectID":"870f7718998058c502ffb7060e7e322e","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/project/emotion/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T09:06:10+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/emotion/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["facial-expression-analysis","FER"],"title":"Emotion Classification","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yunjia Sun","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635245691,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635245691,"objectID":"d309fcc9f45eee214a075d65c83de673","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2021-iccv-crossencoder/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T18:54:51+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-iccv-crossencoder/","section":"publication","summary":"in Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision(ICCV), 2021.","tags":["selected","gaze-estimation","self-supervised-learning"],"title":"Cross-Encoder for Unsupervised Gaze Representation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Cai","Boyu Chen","Jiabei Zeng","Jiajun Zhang","Yunjia Sun","Xiao Wang","Zhilong Ji","Xiao Liu","Xilin Chen","Shiguang Shan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622448976,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622448976,"objectID":"ee189de6ffd0de457afe4650f5986eb2","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2021-xgazechal/","publishdate":"2021-05-31T16:16:16+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-xgazechal/","section":"publication","summary":"Our method won ETH-XGaze Challenge@CVPR2021.","tags":["gaze-estimation"],"title":"Gaze Estimation with an Ensemble of Four Architectures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuanhang Zhang","Rulin Huang","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1608989143,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608989143,"objectID":"32b295895e71dbbb5da4af5ae4246747","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2020-fgw-va/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T21:25:43+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-fgw-va/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a multi-modal multi-feature (M3F) approach for in-the-wild valence-arousal estimation.

The GAP feature is then used for the subsequent engagement level prediction. To efficiently predict the engagement level for a long-time video, we divide the long-time video into multiple overlapped video clips and extract GAP feature for each clip. A deep model consisting of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer and a fully connected layer is used as the engagement predictor.

It projects the data into a low-dimensional subspace and keeps the projected data distinguishable in different classes. In addition to preserving the discriminant information for binary or multiple classes, some real-world applications also require keeping the preference degrees of assigning the data to multiple aspects, e.g., to keep the different intensities for co-occurring facial expressions or the product ratings in different aspects. To address this issue, we propose a novel supervised DR method for DR in multiple ordinal regression (DRMOR), whose projected subspace preserves all the ordinal information in multiple aspects or labels. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization framework to simultaneously perform DR and ordinal regression. In contrast to most existing DR methods, which are conducted independently of the subsequent classification or ordinal regression, the proposed framework fully benefits from both of the procedures. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DRMOR method (DRMOR-M) well preserves the ordinal information from all the aspects or labels in the learned subspace. Moreover, DRMOR-M exhibits advantages compared with representative DR or ordinal regression algorithms on three standard data sets.","tags":[],"title":"Dimensionality Reduction in Multiple Ordinal Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong Li","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1534425845,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534425845,"objectID":"9abff838b42ff5396f75af8e69fb5fb5","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2018-icpr-pg/","publishdate":"2018-08-16T21:24:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-icpr-pg/","section":"publication","summary":"in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2018.

To make full use of the limited data, we propose a novel multi-channel pose-aware convolution neural network (MPCNN) that consists of three parts: the multi-channel feature extraction, jointly multi-scale feature fusion, and the pose-aware recognition. The feature extraction part has 3 sub-CNNs and it learns convolutional features from different features. The joint fusion part fuses multi-scale features to enhance high-level feature representation in a hierarchical way. The fused features are fed to the pose-aware recognition part that includes pose-specific recognition branches and a pose estimation sub-network. According to the estimated pose, MPCNN finally classifies the facial expression through a conditional weighted combination of the pose-specific recognition branches. MPCNN is end-to-end trainable by minimizing the joint loss of pose and expression recognition. We evaluated the proposed method on two public multi-view FER datasets (BU-3DFE and KDEF) and a FER dataset in the wild (SFEW).

However, existing kinship verification methods suffer from the lack of large scale real-world data. Without enough training data, it is difficult to learn proper features that are discriminant for blood-related peoples. In this work, we propose KinNet, a fine-to-coarse deep metric learning framework for kinship verification. In the framework, we transfer knowledge from the large-scale-data-driven face recognition task, which is a fine-grained version of kinship recognition, by pre-training the network with massive data for face recognition. Then, the network is fine-tuned to find a metric space where kin-related peoples are discriminant. The metric space is learned by minimizing a soft triplet loss on the augmented kinship dataset. An augmented strategy is proposed to balance the amount of images per family member. Finally, we ensemble four networks to further boost the performance. The experimental results on the 1st Large-Scale Kinship Recognition Data Challenge (Track 1) demonstrate that our KinNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance in kinship verification.","tags":[],"title":"Kinnet: Fine-to-coarse Deep Metric Learning for Kinship Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiabei Zeng","Wen-Sheng Chu","Fernando de la Torre","Jeffery F.

However, most recent approaches only deal with the images’ primordial-extracted features and ignore their hidden relationships. Considering these latent characters, a visual-topic-model 3-D object retrieval approach is introduced in this paper. In this framework, dense scale invariant feature transform(dense-SIFT) descriptors are extracted from a set of views of each 3-D object, and all the dense-SIFT descriptors are grouped into bag-of-word features using k-means clustering. Then, the topic distribution of a 3-D object is generated via latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) given its bag-of-word features. Gibbs sampling is applied in the learning and inference processing of LDA. We conduct experiments on the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB) and National Taiwan University 3D model database (NTU), and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better retrieval effectiveness than the state-of-the-art methods under several standard evaluation measures.","tags":[],"title":"3-D Object Retrieval using Topic Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Leng","Jiabei Zeng","Ming Yao","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1422278818,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422278818,"objectID":"8df38fd0f3d9310d3e30dd2df9a0a944","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2015-tip-3d/","publishdate":"2015-01-26T21:26:58+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-tip-3d/","section":"publication","summary":"View-based 3D model retrieval uses a set of views to represent each object.

The results of experiments, using the historical data of Beijing subway, show that although the proposed method has lower performance than existing prediction approaches for forecasting exit passenger flows, it is able to predict several additional kinds of passenger flow in stations and throughout the subway system; and it is a more feasible, suitable, and advanced passenger flow prediction model for Beijing subway system.","tags":[],"title":"Probability tree based passenger flow prediction and its application to the Beijing subway system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiabei Zeng","Biao Leng","Zhang Xiong","Zheng Qin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1314365242,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314365242,"objectID":"97665f4938a53c85111bedad09c63fcf","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2011-phy/","publishdate":"2011-08-26T21:27:22+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-phy/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, an extended FF model (floor field model) to simulate pedestrian dynamics in complex scenarios is proposed.

A pedestrian's view is limited to a convex polygon. When they travel from one convex area to another, they make decisions about the next goal according to the distances between them and the candidate goals, as well as densities of capacity and herding behaviors. Meanwhile, after making an initial decision about the next goal, a pedestrian can estimate the travel time to reach each visible goal and change their path adaptively within the convex area.
