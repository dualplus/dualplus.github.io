AUs correspond to muscular activities that produce momentary changes in facial appearance. Combinations of AUs can represent any facial expression. As a multilabel classification problem, AU detection suffers from insufficient AU annotations, various head poses, individual differences, and imbalance among different AUs. This article systematically summarizes representative methods that have been proposed since 2016 to facilitate the development of AU detection methods. According to different input data, AU detection methods are categorized on the basis of images, videos, and other modalities. We also discuss how AU detection methods can deal with partial supervision given the large scale of unlabeled data. Image-based methods, including approaches that learn local facial representations, exploit AU relations and utilize multitask and weakly supervised learning methods. Handcrafted or automatically learned local facial representations can represent local deformations caused by active AUs. However, the former is incapable of representing different AUs with adaptive local regions while the latter suffers from insufficient training data. Approaches that exploit AU relations can utilize prior knowledge that some AUs appear together or exclusively at the same time. Such methods adopt either Bayesian or graph neural networks to model manually inferred AU relations from annotations of specified datasets. However, these inflexible methods fail to perform cross dataset evaluation. Multitask AU detection methods are inspired by the phenomena that facial shapes represented by facial landmarks are helpful in AU detection and facial deformations caused by active AUs affect the location distribution of landmarks. Except for detecting facial AUs, such methods typically estimate facial landmarks or recognize facial expressions in a multitask manner. Other tasks of facial emotion analysis, such as emotional dimension estimation, can be incorporated in the multitask learning setting. Video-based methods are categorized into strategies that rely on temporal representation and self-supervised learning. Temporal representation learning methods commonly adopt long short-term memory (LSTM) or 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) to model the temporal information. Other temporal representation approaches utilize optical flow between frames to detect facial AUs. Several self-supervised approaches have recently exploited the prior knowledge that facial actions, which are movements of facial muscles and between facial frames, can be used as the self-supervisory signal. Such video-based weakly supervised AU detection methods are reasonable and explainable and can effectively alleviate the problem of insufficient AU annotations. However, these methods rely on massive amounts of unlabeled video data in the training phase and fail to perform AU detection in an end-to-end manner. We also review methods that exploit point cloud or thermal images for AU detection and are capable of alleviating the influence of head pose or illumination. Finally, we compare representative methods and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. The analysis summarizes and discusses challenges and potential directions of AU detection. We conclude that methods capable of utilizing weakly annotated or unlabeled data are important research directions for future investigations. Such methods should be carefully designed according to the prior knowledge of AUs to alleviate the demand for large amounts of labeled data.","tags":["facial expression"],"title":"Progress and Challenges in Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanyu Liu","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606397149,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606397149,"objectID":"992f897ac9bd82f34ccf479841055ab9","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2020-fgw-emot/","publishdate":"2020-11-26T21:25:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-fgw-emot/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a method for facial expression recognition for in-the-wild videos.

The GAP feature is then used for the subsequent engagement level prediction. To efficiently predict the engagement level for a long-time video, we divide the long-time video into multiple overlapped video clips and extract GAP feature for each clip. A deep model consisting of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer and a fully connected layer is used as the engagement predictor. Finally, a mean pooling layer is applied to the per-clip estimation to get the final engagement level of the whole video. Experimental results on the validation set and test set show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

It projects the data into a low-dimensional subspace and keeps the projected data distinguishable in different classes. In addition to preserving the discriminant information for binary or multiple classes, some real-world applications also require keeping the preference degrees of assigning the data to multiple aspects, e.g., to keep the different intensities for co-occurring facial expressions or the product ratings in different aspects. To address this issue, we propose a novel supervised DR method for DR in multiple ordinal regression (DRMOR), whose projected subspace preserves all the ordinal information in multiple aspects or labels. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization framework to simultaneously perform DR and ordinal regression. In contrast to most existing DR methods, which are conducted independently of the subsequent classification or ordinal regression, the proposed framework fully benefits from both of the procedures. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed DRMOR method (DRMOR-M) well preserves the ordinal information from all the aspects or labels in the learned subspace. Moreover, DRMOR-M exhibits advantages compared with representative DR or ordinal regression algorithms on three standard data sets.","tags":[],"title":"Dimensionality Reduction in Multiple Ordinal Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong Li","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1534425845,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534425845,"objectID":"9abff838b42ff5396f75af8e69fb5fb5","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2018-icpr-pg/","publishdate":"2018-08-16T21:24:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-icpr-pg/","section":"publication","summary":"Facial expression recognition in the wild is challenging due to various un-constrained conditions. Although existing facial expression classifiers have been almost perfect on analyzing constrained frontal faces, they fail to perform well on partially occluded faces that are common in the wild. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable Patch-Gated Convolution Neutral Network (PG-CNN) that can automatically percept the occluded region of the face and focus on the most discriminative un-occluded regions. To determine the possible regions of interest on the face, PG-CNN decomposes an intermediate feature map into several patches according to the positions of related facial landmarks. Then, via a proposed Patch-Gated Unit, PG-CNN reweighs each patch by the unobstructed-ness or importance that is computed from the patch itself. The proposed PG-CNN is evaluated on two largest in-the-wild facial expression datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet) and their modifications with synthesized facial occlusions. Experimental results show that PG-CNN improves the recognition accuracy on both the original faces and faces with synthesized occlusions. Visualization results demonstrate that, compared with the CNN without Patch-Gated Unit, PG-CNN is capable of shifting the attention from the occluded patch to other related but unobstructed ones. Experiments also show that PG-CNN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several widely used in-the-lab facial expression datasets under the cross-dataset evaluation protocol.","tags":["facial expression"],"title":"Patch-gated CNN for Occlusion-aware Facial Expression Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuanyuan Liu","Jiabei Zeng","Shiguang Shan","Zhuo Zheng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527432570,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527432570,"objectID":"40c4dbb98b7e2fdcf119326e6e6bfec2","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2018-fg-yuanyuan/","publishdate":"2018-05-27T22:49:30+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-fg-yuanyuan/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Channel Pose-Aware Convolution Neural Networks for Multi-View Facial Expression Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong Li","Jiabei Zeng","Jie Zhang","Anbo Dai","Meina Kan","Shiguang Shan","Xilin Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1504272366,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504272366,"objectID":"eb7bf6ee3cf388a77e677a634ab5a6c5","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2017-acmmmw-kinship/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T21:26:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-acmmmw-kinship/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic kinship verification has attracted increasing attentions as it holds promise to an abundance of applications. However, existing kinship verification methods suffer from the lack of large scale real-world data. Without enough training data, it is difficult to learn proper features that are discriminant for blood-related peoples. In this work, we propose KinNet, a fine-to-coarse deep metric learning framework for kinship verification. In the framework, we transfer knowledge from the large-scale-data-driven face recognition task, which is a fine-grained version of kinship recognition, by pre-training the network with massive data for face recognition. Then, the network is fine-tuned to find a metric space where kin-related peoples are discriminant. The metric space is learned by minimizing a soft triplet loss on the augmented kinship dataset.

While progress has been made, accurate detection of facial AUs remains challenging due to ubiquitous sources of errors, such as inter-personal variability, pose, and low-intensity AUs. In this paper, we refer to samples causing such errors as hard samples, and the remaining as easy samples. To address learning with the hard samples, we propose the confidence preserving machine (CPM), a novel two-stage learning framework that combines multiple classifiers following an ‚Äúeasy-to-hard‚Äù strategy. During the training stage, CPM learns two confident classifiers. Each classifier focuses on separating easy samples of one class from all else, and thus preserves confidence on predicting each class. During the test stage, the confident classifiers provide ‚Äúvirtual labels‚Äù for easy test samples. Given the virtual labels, we propose a quasi-semi-supervised (QSS) learning strategy to learn a person-specific classifier. The QSS strategy employs a spatio-temporal smoothness that encourages similar predictions for samples within a spatio-temporal neighborhood. In addition, to further improve detection performance, we introduce two CPM extensions: iterative CPM that iteratively augments training samples to train the confident classifiers, and kernel CPM that kernelizes the original CPM model to promote nonlinearity. Experiments on four spontaneous data sets GFT, BP4D, DISFA, and RU-FACS illustrate the benefits of the proposed CPM models over baseline methods and the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning and transfer learning methods.","tags":["selected","facial expression"],"title":"Confidence Preserving Machine for Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else; a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples. During testing, CPM then learns a person-specific classifier using ``virtual labels'' provided by confident classifiers. This step is achieved using a quasi-semi-supervised (QSS) approach. Hard samples are typically close to the decision boundary, and the QSS approach disambiguates them using spatio-temporal constraints. To evaluate CPM, we compared it with a baseline single-margin classifier and state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and boosting methods in three datasets of spontaneous facial behavior. With few exceptions, CPM outperformed baseline and state-of-the art methods.","tags":["facial expression"],"title":"Confidence Preserving Machine for Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wen-Sheng Chu","Jiabei Zeng","Fernando de la Torre","Jeffery F.

For computational efficiency, we develop a branch-and-bound (B\u0026B) approach that affords exhaustive search while guaranteeing a globally optimal solution. The proposed method is entirely general. It takes from two or more videos any multi-dimensional signal that can be represented as a histogram. We derive three novel bounding functions and provide efficient extensions, including multi-synchrony detection and accelerated search, using a warm-start strategy and parallelism. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in multiple databases, including human actions using the CMU Mocap dataset, spontaneous facial behaviors using group-formation task dataset and parent-infant interaction dataset.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised Synchrony Discovery in Human Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiabei Zeng","Biao Leng","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1441114031,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441114031,"objectID":"d89b05431c6bc86100f344b3b6beeae4","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2015-mta-3d/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T21:27:11+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-mta-3d/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"3-D Object Retrieval using Topic Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Leng","Jiabei Zeng","Ming Yao","Zhang Xiong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1422278818,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422278818,"objectID":"8df38fd0f3d9310d3e30dd2df9a0a944","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2015-tip-3d/","publishdate":"2015-01-26T21:26:58+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-tip-3d/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"3D Object Retrieval with Multi-topic Model Combining Relevance Feedback and LDA Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Biao Leng","Jiabei Zeng","Zhang Xiong","Weifeng Lv","Yueliang Wan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1372771650,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372771650,"objectID":"838c9c9f33a07da764b92c2bbf68de0f","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2013-metro/","publishdate":"2013-07-02T21:27:30+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-metro/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probability tree based passenger flow prediction and its application to the Beijing subway system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiabei Zeng","Biao Leng","Zhang Xiong","Zheng Qin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1314365242,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314365242,"objectID":"97665f4938a53c85111bedad09c63fcf","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/publication/2011-phy/","publishdate":"2011-08-26T21:27:22+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-phy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Pedestrian dynamics in a two-dimensional complex scenario using a local view floor field model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://dualplus.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
